"""Comparative scanning — diff two AuditReports to track remediation progress.

Usage from CLI:
    winposture --baseline baseline.json   # save current scan as baseline
    winposture --compare  baseline.json   # compare current scan against baseline

The diff identifies:
  - New findings: FAIL/WARN in current scan that weren't in the baseline
  - Resolved findings: FAIL/WARN in baseline that are now PASS/INFO in current
  - Worsened findings: check was PASS/INFO in baseline, now FAIL/WARN
  - Score delta: points gained or lost since the baseline
